      "12 AND HOLDING      Written by    Anthony S Cipriano          04.06.04        FADE IN:    EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING    TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes  through a suburban neighborhood.    Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck  pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears  over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The  boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.    INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS    Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.  Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a  TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys  cautiously look around and whisper.    JACOB  You see `em?    RUDY  No. But that doesn't mean they're  not here.    After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking  towards the tree house. Jacob stays behind, eyeing their  safety.    RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Jacob, come on. It's cool.    Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen. It hits  Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.    Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and  debris come flying at him.    As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his  mask. He quickly runs for the tree.    TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come  running out of the woods, rocks in hand.    Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are  nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a  DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and  unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.    2.        INT. TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS    Jacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy  crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.    JACOB  What the hell is that?    RUDY  Piss.    Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.    EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME    Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,  screaming. They try to shake the urine off.    Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up  to the boys.    KENNY  You and your deformed brother are  dead!    INT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME    Jacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY  BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted.    RUDY  (calling to Kenny)  Anytime you're ready, dickhead.    EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME    Jeff and Kenny walk off.    KENNY  They're fucking dead!    Jeff runs off screen and throws up.    INT. FISHER HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING    LEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner  table, eating pancakes.    His FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8)  and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight.          (CONTINUED)    3.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all,  crosses to the table, sits and starts eating.    JUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of  syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of  omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks.    EST. EXT. CHUNG RESIDENCE - MORNING    A modern, upper-class home with a large, well tended yard.    YACCO (O.S.)  The check is supposed to be here on  the first of the month... She's  your daughter, you asshole!    INT. CHUNG HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS    YACCO CHUANG (35), Asian-American, sexy, uptight,  psychiatrist, paces the hallway on the phone.    HER DAUGHTER, MALEE (12) with long, black, braided hair and  thick rimmed glasses, peeks her head out of the bathroom.    MALEE  Mom, I need help.    YACCO (INTO PHONE)  (ignoring her)  Any parent is \"parent of the year\"  next to you, you selfish prick.    Yacco walks off. Deflated, Malee reenters the bathroom.    INT. CHUNG HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS    Malee is wrapped in a towel and holding a TAMPON. Confused,  she grabs the TAMPON BOX and reads the directions. Malee's  confusion quickly turns to disgust.    EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD ENTRANCE - LATER    Leonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES  inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off  the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which  reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC. ALL INVITED.    Malee rides her bike up to Leonard. She HONKS her BIKE HORN  at every pedestrian in her path.    MALEE  Move it, people. Outta my way!      (CONTINUED)    4.  CONTINUED:    She comes to a screeching halt an inch in front of Leonard.    LEONARD  (mouthful)  You're late.    MALEE  Yeah well, I began menstruating  this morning, and I had some  difficulty inserting the tampon.  (off his disgusted look)  What? It's a natural process. You  know, I could conceive, carry and  birth a child right now.    LEONARD  Big deal. You won't.    MALEE  But I could. That's what matters.    LEONARD  The twins said, they'd meet us at  the spot.    Leonard gets on his bike.    MALEE  Wanna race?    LEONARD  Nah, I'm good.    INT. TREE HOUSE - LATER    Jacob wipes at his head wound, frightened.    JACOB  Maybe I should have mom look at it.    RUDY  If you didn't have that damn mask  on, you'd have seen it coming. Our  birthday comes once a year, and you  ask for a hockey mask. You don't  even play.    JACOB  Jason from \"Friday the 13th\" wears  one. He's bad ass.          (CONTINUED)    5.  CONTINUED:    RUDY  Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home  `cause of a little blood. He'd get  back up, decapitate his victim and  move on.    Jacob looks out the makeshift window in the wall.    JACOB  You think Jeff and Kenny will come  back?    RUDY  I dropped piss on their heads. I'd  say the odds are pretty good.    MALEE (O.S.)  You did what?    Rudy and Jacob turn to find Malee and Leonard, entering the  tree house.    RUDY  Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped  the piss I've been saving on their  heads.    LEONARD  Why were you saving piss?    RUDY  Just incase. Pretty smart, huh?    JACOB  No, it's stupid cause now they're  gonna come back here and kick all  our asses.    RUDY  Don't be such a pussy.    LEONARD  Yeah, I could probably take them  both myself.    RUDY  What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat  them?    JACOB  All I'm saying is, who cares if  they tear it down.      (CONTINUED)    6.  CONTINUED: (2)    RUDY  This is OUR place. We've been  coming here since we were seven.    JACOB  Nothing lasts forever.    RUDY  You're such a butt-munch.    Rudy pushes Jacob. Jacob pushes back. The two start  fighting.    MALEE  You guys, it's your birthday.  Could you try and get along?    Off the boy's fighting -    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON    Yacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife,  conservatively dressed.    DEBBIE  I don't think therapy is helping.    YACCO  Why do you say that? Are you still  \"cutting\"?    Embarrassed, Maggie lifts up her shirt sleeve. We see that  her arm is covered with cuts. Dried blood is everywhere.  Yacco is horrified by the sight.    YACCO (cont'd)  Oh, Debbie.    DEBBIE  It feels much better than it looks.  Really.    Suddenly, Malee bursts into her mother's office.    MALEE  Ma, I... Oops.    YACCO  Malee, out. Now.    MALEE  I'm sorry.      (CONTINUED)    7.  CONTINUED:    Malee quickly exits the office.    YACCO  Excuse me for a moment.    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS    Yacco enters the reception area. She is obviously angry.    YACCO  I told you a 100 times to knock.    MALEE  I said, I was sorry.    YACCO  Why aren't you with the boys?    MALEE  Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with  their parents.    Yacco crosses to a desk and removes a FLUTE from a drawer.    YACCO  I found this in the backseat of my  car this morning. Do you know how  much flutes cost? Go outside, sit  on the front steps and practice.    MALEE  But, mom.    YACCO  Now!    Angered, Malee grabs the flute and exits.    EXT. FRONT OF YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    Malee drops on the stoop like a ton of bricks. After a beat,  she reluctantly begins playing her flute.    A few pedestrians stop to listen.    MALEE  Keep it moving. This ain't a show.    INT. TWIN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT    Rudy and Jacob stare into the camera with big grins.        (CONTINUED)    8.  CONTINUED:    RUDY/JACOB  Cheese!    VFX: CAMERA FLASH    The boys relax their poses as ASHLEY and JIM CARGES (30's),  enter the shot. Ashley puts her camera down on the table and  picks up a large PRESENT.    JIM  Okay, you got your small gifts this  morning. Now for the big ones.    ASHLEY  This one is Rudy's.    Rudy rips into the present, revealing a SONY PLAY STATION.    RUDY  Sony play station! Oh my God! Oh  my God! Yes! Too cool!    JIM  Since neither of you wanted a party  this year, we were able to splurge.    Ashley removes an ENVELOPE from her purse. She hands it to  Jacob. His enthusiasm suddenly turns to worry.    JACOB  What is it?    ASHLEY  Only one way to find out.    Jacob removes a colorful PAMPHLET from the envelope.    JIM  Go ahead, read it.    JACOB  \"Plastic Surgery. Isn't it about  time?\"  (horrified)  I don't get it.    ASHLEY  Your father and I are going to pay  to have your birthmark removed.    JIM  Isn't that great.      (CONTINUED)    9.  CONTINUED: (2)    JACOB  You got me surgery for my birthday?    JIM  Not just one. A series of them.    RUDY  (overcompensating)  Cool.    JACOB  It's not \"cool\". It totally sucks!    Jacob drops the envelope, walks from the room.    JIM  Jacob?    INT. TWIN'S HOUSE - BOY'S BEDROOM - LATER    Rudy enters the darkened room and crosses over to Jacob, who  has his face planted in his pillow. Jacob has been crying.    RUDY  Don't sweat it. You can borrow my  play station anytime you want.    JACOB  This isn't about the play station.  It's about this thing on my face.  Everybody hates it.    RUDY  I don't.    JACOB  Who cares what you think? You're  the reason for all of this.  Perfect you with your perfect skin.  There to show the world what I'm  supposed to look like.  (beat)  You know, sometimes I just wish I  wasn't your twin.    RUDY  Screw you! Know what, I take it  back, you can't use my play  station.    Rudy exits the room, slamming the door after him.    10.        EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT DAY    It's your typical fourth of July block party. Families crowd  the streets with BBQ GRILLS, cotton candy and beer. Children  ride their bicycles, which are adorned with streamers,  balloons and noise makers.    Off to the side, Malee and Jacob sit, eating SNOW CONES.    EXT. STREET - SAME TIME    Jim Carges tends to some burgers on his grill. GABE ARTUNION  (40), real estate agent, approaches.    GABE  30 acres.    JIM  I already told you, Gabe, I'm not  selling that land. Not 30 acres  not five.    GABE  I'm willing to pay top dollar.    JIM  I'm not gonna let you tear down  those woods, so you can stack  twenty houses right on top of each  other.    GABE  I'm gonna write down a number.    JIM  No! My kids... hell, your kids  play in those woods all the time.  You can't put a price on that.    Gabe writes down a number and hands it to Jim.    GABE  I believe I can.    Jim looks at the figure and his eyes go wide.    EXT. STREET - LATER    A line of PICNIC TABLES surround nearby GRILLS. Leonard's  family minus Leonard sit, eating as if there's no tomorrow.          (CONTINUED)    11.  CONTINUED:    SOCCER MOM # 1 (O.S.)  Look at them. So unhealthy.    ON TWO SOCCER MOMS, watching Leonard's family eat.    SOCCER MOM # 1 (cont'd)  You know, Grace can barely walk  because of her weight.    SOCCER MOM # 2  Where do you think she finds  clothes big enough to fit?    The two woman walk off. As they disperse, we see LEONARD,  standing behind them. He has heard every word.    Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows  with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted.    Patrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table.    PATRICK  Good eating, huh son?    Patrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate.    LEONARD  Maybe you shouldn't have seconds,  Dad, you know?    PATRICK  Who are you, Richard Simmons?  C'mon, enjoy the day.    He walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food,  shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion.    EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE STREET - DUSK    RUDY straddles his bike while watching a group of 8-year-  olds, having a water balloon fight. Jealous, he  reminiscences to a time when he was one of those kids.    KENNY  (o.s. )  Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree  house of yours a little visit  tonight.    Rudy spins around to find Kenny, standing at his side.          (CONTINUED)    12.  CONTINUED:    KENNY (cont'd)  When we're through, it'll be a pile  of scrap.    RUDY  Why don't you take your smelly ass  back to the trailer park?    KENNY  Free country, asshole.    RUDY  You got nothing better to do than  pick on us all the time?    KENNY  I did until yesterday.    RUDY  I thought you liked \"golden  showers\". Oh no, that was your  mother.    Kenny pushes Rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him.  Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of  kids surround them, chanting, \"FIGHT, FIGHT\".    Jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face. Rudy screams as  the stream of saliva, drips across his nose and onto his lip.    NEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.)  What's going on over there?    Kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over.    KENNY  I'll finish this tonight!    Kenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off. Rudy slowly  rises, wiping the saliva from his face.    EXT. VACANT LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT    The entire neighborhood has descended upon a VACANT LOT.  They are awaiting the annual, fireworks display.    We FIND Leonard, Jacob and Malee sitting on a large rock,  which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd.    Rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top.          (CONTINUED)    13.  CONTINUED:    RUDY  Kenny showed up. He said, Jeff and  him are gonna tear the treehouse  down tonight. We gotta sneak out  and stop them.    JACOB  Mom and Dad would kill us.    RUDY  We can't let him tear it down.    JACOB  It's just a treehouse.    RUDY  No, it's not! You know what, you  suck. I'm going. Leonard, you in?    JACOB  You don't have to go if you don't  want to.    RUDY  Don't listen to him. He's a pussy.    Leonard looks between Jacob and Malee.    LEONARD  I'll go.    RUDY  Finally, someone with balls.    Insulted, Jacob slides off the rock and walks away. Malee  follows.    RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Let them go.    The fireworks display begins. As they turn to watch it...    INT. TWIN'S HOME - BOY'S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT    We SCAN the room and come to a set of BUNK BEDS.    SFX: ELECTRIC WATCH ALARM    A body in the top bunk sits up and turns on a small bed  light. Reveal, it's RUDY. Rudy grabs his watch from the  post and silences the alarm. Jacob sits up in bed.        (CONTINUED)    14.  CONTINUED:    JACOB  Rudy.    RUDY  Unless you're coming with me, I  don't want to hear it.    Jacob lies back in bed, silent. Rudy jumps off the top bunk,  gets dressed and grabs a BASEBALL BAT. Before leaving, Rudy  looks back at Jacob and shakes his head, disappointed.    RUDY (cont'd)  You know, you can't be a pussy all  your life.    JACOB  What?    RUDY  Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the  time, and you don't do shit.    JACOB  It's my problem.    RUDY  No, it's mine too. Cause we're  brothers. That's what brothers do.  They fight for each other, kill for  each other, die for each other.    JACOB  I don't feel that way.    RUDY  Cause you're a pussy. So stay  home, keep your head under the  blankets. I'm gonna fight.    With that, Rudy disappears out the window.    FADE TO BLACK:    DARKNESS... SFX: CREAKING DOOR. A FLASHLIGHT illuminates the  location. We are...    INT. TREEHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT    Leonard and Rudy enter with the help of a flashlight.    Leonard reaches inside his backpack and removes a number of  SNACK CAKES from his backpack.      (CONTINUED)    15.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  (re: snack cakes)  Some provisions.    RUDY  We're only gonna be here a couple  of hours.    LEONARD  When two o'clock rolls around,  you'll be begging for one of these.    Rudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack.    LEONARD (cont'd)  (re: baseball bat)  I didn't bring my glove.    RUDY  Moron, the bat is for Jeff and  Kenny. You know, to scare them a  little.    He swings it hard.    RUDY (cont'd)  Maybe it's best if we don't talk.  Just listen. Listen for them, and  don't fall asleep.    LEONARD  I'm wide awake. I could stay up  all night.    EST. EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT NIGHT    The treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in  the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets  fills the air.    INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS    Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window  and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it  in his sleep, wakes himself up.    LEONARD  Oh, shit.    Rudy jumps awake.          (CONTINUED)    16.  CONTINUED:    RUDY  What... What is it? They here?    LEONARD  No.    Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in  the floor. He is about to exit.    RUDY  Where you going?    LEONARD  They're not gonna show up, I'm  goin' home. It's three o'clock-    Suddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window.  It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames.    EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME    Jeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse.  Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside.    KENNY  Now yours. And aim for the window.    Jeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes  into the side of the tree house.    KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Ha ha, you suck.    Jeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside.    JEFF  You hear that?    INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME    Rudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming.    RUDY  Put it out! Put it out!    Leonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack,  but it's of no use. He spins around and finds the wall  behind him, engulfed with flames. He screams, terrified.    EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME    Jeff and Kenny are frantic.      (CONTINUED)    17.  CONTINUED:    JEFF  They're in there! They're in  there!    Jeff turns around and runs back home through the woods.    INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME    Leonard backs away from Rudy. Unfortunately, he doesn't  realize that the door in the floor is open.    EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME    We watch over Kenny's shoulder as Leonard falls from the  treehouse, smacks his head on the tree trunk and comes to a  crash upon some rocks. Kenny runs over and finds Leonard  unconscious.    KENNY  Wake up! Wake up, kid!    Off the treehouse, which is now a towering inferno -    INT. TWIN'S HOUSE - PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Ashley jumps up from a deep sleep. There is terror on her  face. She rushes over to her DESK and turns on the LAMP.  Ken is awakened by her.    JIM  Ashley? What is it?    ASHLEY  I forgot to deposit your paycheck  last week.    JIM  But I already wrote some checks.    ASHLEY  I know. With the cookout and  everything, I forgot. I'll deposit  it tomorrow. The holiday should  buy us an extra day.    JIM  Write yourself a note so you don't  forget again.    ASHLEY  I just did.        (CONTINUED)    18.  CONTINUED:    Ashley turns off the desk lamp and returns to bed.    ASHLEY (cont'd)  Goodnite.    FADE TO BLACK:    SFX OVER BLACK : TELEPHONE RINGING    FADE IN:    EXT. GRAVEYARD - WEEKS LATER - AFTERNOON    ON JIM and ASHLEY, watching Rudy's casket as it is lowered  into the ground. The once spirited, couple now looks tired  and pained. They are accompanied by a number of mourners.    PRIEST  Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene  Carges. May God hold you in the  palm of his hand.    Jacob stands beside his parents. Tears stream from his eyes,  across his birthmark and off his chin. So stricken with  grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away.    We continue on through the crowd and find Malee. Embarrassed  by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face.    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY    Malee enters, still wearing the veil. She crosses to the  couch and sits beside A PATIENT, GUS MAITLAND (30), long  haired, hippi-type with a moustache and beard. Gus eyes  Malee, intrigued.    GUS  Friend or family?    MALEE  Huh?    GUS  The person who died.    MALEE  Friend.    GUS  I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung.  This is only my second session, but  she's good.      (CONTINUED)    19.  CONTINUED:    MALEE  I'm not a patient. I'm her  daughter.    Malee lifts her veil and looks at Gus.    GUS  Oh. I can see the resemblance.    MALEE  Are you trying to make me sick?    Gus shoots Malee a look just as Yacco exits her office.    YACCO  Mr. Maitland?    Gus rises and enters the office.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I'll be with you in a second.    Yacco crosses to Malee and sits beside her.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  So, how was it?    MALEE  It was a funeral, Mom. How do you  think it was?    YACCO  I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let  Rudy's parents know I'm available  if they need to talk. I won't  charge for the sessions.    Malee looks to Yacco, stunned by her comment.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You know, it's okay to cry.    MALEE  I know it's okay to cry. I don't  need you to tell me, it's okay to  cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.    YACCO  Okay.    Yacco re-enters her office. A beat.        (CONTINUED)    20.  CONTINUED: (2)    Malee starts to cry.    EXT. JACOB'S HOME - LATER THAT AFTERNOON    Cars fill the driveway and line the street in front of  Jacob's house.    INT. TWIN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME    Mourners stand in small groups, engaged in hushed  conversations. Jim sits in his recliner, crying.    INT. TWIN'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME    A number of MOTHERS watch as Ashley obsessively prepares a  platter of deviled eggs. Concerned, one of them crosses over  to her.    MOTHER  Ashley, there's more than enough  food here.    ASHLEY  No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs.  It's right that I make them.  Where's the paprika?    Ashley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika.    ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Jesus, you put something down, and  it disappears.    Now angry, Ashley starts throwing objects out of the  cupboards, haphazardly.    MOTHER # 1  Ashley.    Ashley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and  spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen.    ASHLEY  Maybe I threw it out.    Ashley crosses to the garbage. She lifts it upside down and  dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees  and starts searching.    The other women look to each other, uncomfortable. Mother #  1 kneels down beside her.        (CONTINUED)    21.  CONTINUED:    MOTHER # 1  Ashley.    Ashley ignores her. Mother # 1 grabs Ashley's hands and  looks her in the eye.    ASHLEY  It's okay.    Ashley stops cold. The grief and heartache hit once again.    ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Not my baby! Please God not my son!    The mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround  Ashley in an attempt to comfort her. They give no care to  the pile of garbage they now sit in.    INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY    Leonard lies in a bed, staring out the window. There is a  BANDAGE wrapped around his forehead. Patrick sits beside him  in a chair.    Grace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her.    GRACE  This hospital is a nightmare. The  elevator is never there when you  need it.    Patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch.    PATRICK  Where are the girls?    GRACE  Haley took Sara up to the maternity  ward.    Grace crosses over to Leonard.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  How are you feeling?    LEONARD  My head hurts.    GRACE  You're lucky you didn't get killed.          (CONTINUED)    22.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  I told you, I'm sorry.    GRACE  You try being awakened at four  o'clock in the morning by the  police saying, they have your son,  he's unconscious and on his way to  the hospital. I've never been so  scared in my life. And poor Rudy.    Leonard starts crying.    GRACE (cont'd)  What?    LEONARD  My best friend is dead!    Grace hands Leonard a double cheeseburger.    GRACE  Eat this. It'll make you feel  better.    LEONARD  I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't  taste anything anyway.    GRACE  Hospital food is always bland.  This has flavor.    LEONARD  No, it's because of my condition.  I can't taste or smell anything  anymore.    GRACE  What are you saying, condition?  What condition?    LEONARD  (shrugs)  My condition.    INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER    Patrick and Grace sit across from the DOCTOR (50's).          (CONTINUED)    23.  CONTINUED:    DOCTOR  Leonard has a condition. It's  called Anosmia.    GRACE  Oh my God! Is it serious?    DOCTOR  No. Anosmia is when a person  looses their sense of smell. It's  not uncommon in patients who suffer  serious head injuries.  Unfortunately, it's also affecting  his ability to taste. Again, not  uncommon.    PATRICK  Is it permanent?    DOCTOR  Depends on the patient.    GRACE  What do we do? He can't eat.    DOCTOR  He can eat. He just can't taste  what he's eating.    PATRICK  What she means is, he won't eat.    DOCTOR  Leonard's association with food is  no longer about taste. It's about  texture. While we may be partial  to sweet or salty foods, Leonard  will become partial to crunchy or  smooth ones. Once he settles on a  texture he likes, his appetite will  increase.    GRACE  I can't believe this is happening.    DOCTOR  Considering what Leonard could have  suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he  is severely overweight. A loss of  appetite may be a benefit.    Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death.    24.        INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME    Leonard lies in bed, staring out the window. A NURSE (40)  enters and crosses over to his bedside table.    NURSE  How'd we do?    The nurse sees that Leonard has barely touched his food.    NURSE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You have to eat something. It may  not be gourmet, but you don't look  that finicky.    LEONARD  This stuff feels like shit in my  mouth.    NURSE  It's macaroni and cheese.    LEONARD  It feels gross. Like there's a  film on my tongue.    The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched  apple and places it in Leonard's hand.    LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I don't like apples.    NURSE  So, you can't taste it, right?  Maybe you'll like the crunch.    The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A  beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud  CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a  smile comes to his face. He likes it.    INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He  brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories  come back to him.    Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal  LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box  opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some  firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and  Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile.    25.        INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME    Gabe Artunian crosses over to Jim.    GABE  I'm leaving, Jim. Again, so sorry.    As Gabe turns to leave.    JIM  Gabe, are you still interested in  buying the land? Because I accept  your offer.    GABE  This is hardly the time to talk  business.    JIM  Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear  them down and build. Build houses,  condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I  just don't want to recognize it  ever again.    Off Gabe's look -    SFX OVER SHOT: BUZZING CHAIN SAW    SMASH CUT TO:    EXT. WOODS - THREE WEEKS LATER -AFTERNOON    TIGHT ON a CHAIN SAW chopping down a tree.    WIDEN to REVEAL a CONSTRUCTION CREW, tearing down the last of  the woods. Rows and rows of STUMPS make it look like a  graveyard for trees.    MALEE (O.S.)  It's gone! It's all gone!    We FIND Malee and Jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet  away from the site. Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He  as a band-aid on his forehead.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking  out right now.    Leonard shoots Malee a look. She silences herself.        (CONTINUED)    26.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  You holding up alright, Jacob?    Jacob shrugs.    LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I'm sorry. I wish I could have  done something.    JACOB  Jeff and Kenny were the ones that  started the fire. It was their  fault. Or maybe mine. I should of  been there.    MALEE  You wouldn't have been able to do  anything. And it could have been  you who died.    JACOB  I wish it was. You know the last  thing Rudy said to me? He said, I  can't be a pussy all my life. He  was right, I am. And Rudy might be  dead because of it.    MALEE  Don't say that.  (beat)  Why don't you talk to your parents  about this?    JACOB  They can't help me.    MALEE  Give them time. It'll get better.    JACOB  What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't  gone back to work yet. What if he  loses his job. We could lose our  house. I could be homeless.    MALEE  Then you'll stay with me.    LEONARD  Or me.          (CONTINUED)    27.  CONTINUED: (2)    JACOB  We're best friends. We...    Suddenly, something catches Malee's attention off screen.  It's GUS, standing beside a BULLDOZER.    MALEE  Oh my God.    JACOB  What?    MALEE  That guy. I like know him. He's  one of my mother's patients.    LEONARD  So?    MALEE  I've never seen a patient of hers  actually out and about.  (beat)  Should we go over and say \"hi\"?    JACOB  I just want to get out of here.    Leonard and Jacob start heading off.    Malee stays for a beat, eyeing Gus as he removes his T-shirt  and exposes his rock abs. She is obviously turned on.    LEONARD  You coming, Malee?    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT AFTERNOON    Leonard enters to find Grace, placing a casserole dish on the  table. The table is filled with a cornucopia of food.    LEONARD  Are we having company?    GRACE  No, this is all for you. Your  favorites; fried chicken,  spaghetti, pizza, french fries, and  chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  I made everything extra spicy, so  you can taste it.        (CONTINUED)    28.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  Ma, it doesn't matter how spicy the  food is.    GRACE  So you're not even gonna try it?    LEONARD  I'm sure it's delicious.    GRACE  Forget it. Don't eat.    Grace puts the plate of food into the sink.    GRACE (cont'd)  You can't just eat apples all the  time.    LEONARD  Why not?    GRACE  (beat, searching)  It's unhealthy.    Off Leonard's confusion -    SFX OVER SHOT: SCHOOL BELL    EXT. JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAYS LATER - MORNING    Students make their way inside for the first day of school.  There is a sign out front, which reads: WELCOME BACK.    INT. CLASSROOM - SAME TIME    A TEACHER walks along the line of desks, showing students  their assigned seats.    TEACHER  Tommy Wallace.    Tommy takes his seat.    TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Jacob Carges.    Jacob takes his seat.    TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Rudy Carges.      (CONTINUED)    29.  CONTINUED:    Jacob along with his classmates are shocked to discover that  Rudy's name hasn't been removed from the attendance sheet.    The teacher is unaware of the mistake.    TEACHER (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Rudy Carges. Hello?    Tommy looks to Jacob. Since Rudy's not saying anything, he  will.    TOMMY  He's not in this class anymore.    TEACHER  How do you know?    JACOB  Cause he's dead.    TEACHER  I realize being new at this school  puts me at a disadvantage, but  joking about a fellow classmate's  death is anything but funny, Mr....    The teacher checks her attendance sheet.    TEACHER (cont'd)  ...Carges. Wait, are you...    JACOB  I'm his brother. Was. And I'm not  joking. He's dead.    The teacher looks around at the other students, realizing  Jacob is telling the truth.    TEACHER  I'm so sorry. Wow, this is  awkward. Would you like the seat  left empty?    JACOB  Why?    TEACHER  In memory.    Off Jacob's look -    30.        INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER THAT DAY    COACH GILMORE (55), overweight, gym teacher, dressed in a  jogging suit, snaps gum while addressing his students.    The class of boys stand up against the wall. Leonard is  amongst them. His gym uniform barely fits.    COACH  Alright, ladies, welcome to gym.  We will be starting things off this  year with the United States  Standardized Fitness Test.    The entire class groans.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I'm sure you all remember it from  last year. I will be testing you  in a number of physical fitness  areas.    As coach speaks, Leonard looks as if he's going to throw up.    SMASH CUT TO:    ON CHIN UP BAR - MOMENTS LATER    A STUDENT performs chin ups with great ease.    COACH (V.O.)  The state's requirement for upper  body strength is ten chin ups.    The student finishes his run with a count of twelve. He hops  off the bar and crosses over to his classmates.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard, you're up.    Leonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and  begins struggling to lift himself up. Unfortunately, he can  only manage 1/8th of an inch. Leonard drops off the bar,  exhausted.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What are you doing, let's go!    LEONARD  That was as far as I could pull  myself up.        (CONTINUED)    31.  CONTINUED:    A few students laugh. Coach shakes his head, disgusted.    SMASH CUT TO:    ON A STUDENT DOING SITUPS - LATER    Coach stands over the boy, timing him with a stop watch.    COACH  Ten seconds. You need forty to  pass.    The student increases his speed.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Time. 42. Good job.    The student rises off the mat and walks over to the other  boys. Leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton  of bricks.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  (rolling his eyes)  Go!    Leonard struggles to lift himself up but, he can't do it.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Come on, son, fight it.    Leonard's face turns red. He clenches his teeth.  Unfortunately, due to the pressure he is exerting, he blows a  loud fart. The gym erupts with laughter.    EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - TRACK - LATER    The coach and his students stand at the beginning of the  track, waiting for Leonard to finish his laps.    Leonard slowly walks over. He is soaking wet and breathing  heavy.    COACH  23 minutes.    LEONARD  Not bad.    COACH  The goal was 8.    The class can't help but laugh.      (CONTINUED)    32.  CONTINUED:    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Hit the showers.    The class walks off.    COACH (cont'd)  Not you Leonard.    Leonard turns back and crosses over to the coach.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Center. That's the position you'll  be playing in two years.    LEONARD  Football?    COACH  You don't like football?    LEONARD  I love it. It's just I'll never  make the weight requirement. Pop  Warner league wouldn't let me play  for five years because of it.    COACH  There's no weight requirement in  high school ball, son.    The coach bends down and rifles through his GYM BAG. He  removes 2 books and hands them to Leonard.    COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  These are your new bibles.    LEONARD  Books?    COACH  One is on nutrition, the other  exercise. You do what they say,  and you can play for me once you  get to high school.    LEONARD  Thanks.    Leonard begins walking back to the gym. After a few steps,  he stops and turns back.          (CONTINUED)    33.  CONTINUED: (2)    LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Coach, why are you doing this for  me?    COACH  Because I've never seen a child so  out of shape in my life.    INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT DAY    The school BAND is on stage and playing a particularly  horrendous rendition of the STAR SPANGLED BANNER. We FIND  MALEE in the flute section, playing her heart out.    The CONDUCTOR, MR. FARMER (40) overly energetic and dorky,  waves his baton, silencing the band.    MR FARMER  (annoyed)  Did anyone practice over the  summer?    The band sits silent.    MR. FARMER  Great. Well, we still have a fall  recital coming up. If anyone would  like to perform a solo, sign up on  the sheet outside my office. Class  dismissed.    Off Malee, weighing the decision in her mind.    INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER    Malee stands outside Mr. Farmer's office, staring at the SIGN  UP SHEET on his door. After a beat, she lifts her pen to  sign her name. Before she writes it, she stops, quickly  turns around and walks away.    After a beat, Malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts  writing her name. Halfway through, she stops, scratches out  her name and walks off.    We remain on the sign up sheet. After a few seconds, Malee's  hand enters the shot and writes in her name.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - DEN - EVENING    Jacob enters to find Jim and Ashley fighting.          (CONTINUED)    34.  CONTINUED:    ASHLEY  No, they're wrong. Call them back.    JIM  Ashley, I talked to the lawyer. He  wouldn't lie.    JACOB  What's going on?    ASHLEY  This is all your fault.    JIM  Me?    ASHLEY  If we had gone to the hearings like  I said, this wouldn't be happening.    JIM  We agreed it would be too painful.    ASHLEY  You agreed.    JACOB  Mom, what happened?    Ashley turns to Jacob as if realizing his presence for the  first time.    ASHLEY  Tell him. Tell your son.    JIM  The boys who killed Rudy cut a  deal. They got a year in juvinile  hall and five years probation.    ASHLEY  A year. That's what your brother's  life is worth. A damn year!    JIM  Ashley, calm down!    ASHLEY  How can you be so unaffected by  this! How? Our son was murdered!          (CONTINUED)    35.  CONTINUED: (2)    JIM  (measured)  It was an accident, and the boys  are juveniles.    ASHLEY  So that makes it okay?    Ashley storms out of the room. Jacob looks to his father,  unnerved by the sight of his mother so upset.    Jim just turns and walks into the living room.    FADE TO BLACK:    SFX OVER BLACK: ALARM CLOCK    FADE IN:    INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING    Leonard awakens and silences the alarm. He sits up in bed  for a moment and comes to his senses.    EXT. LEONARD'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER    Dressed in a sweat suit and sneakers, Leonard sprints down  the driveway and to the street. His sweat suit is so tight,  Leonard looks like a stuffed sausage.    With each step he takes, Leonard breathing becomes heavier  and heavier. Sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his  face.    Within seconds, Leonard's pace tapers off. He struggles to  continue but is so out of shape, stopping is inevitable.    Leonard leans over, gasping for air. He looks back and  realizes that he only ran about one hundred yards. In fact,  his house is still in view.    Leonard turns around and starts walking back home. After a  few steps, he stops and throws up.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON    Gus stands inside of a shallow ditch, digging out the roots  of an old tree.    MALEE (O.S.)  Don't I know you?        (CONTINUED)    36.  CONTINUED:    Gus turns and sees Malee behind him, holding a PICNIC BASKET.    GUS  Dr. Chung's daughter.    MALEE  You remembered. We were never  introduced. My name is Malee.    GUS  Gus.    They shake hands.    GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What are you doing here?    MALEE  I was in the mood for a picnic. I  thought this would be a nice place  to have one.    Gus looks around, confused. This location is anything but  picnic friendly. Bulldozers plough through the scene,  blasting exhaust into the air. Men scream at each other.    WORKER (O.S.)  Asshole, move your fucking truck!    MALEE  Would you like to join me? There's  plenty of food.    GUS  I don't go to lunch for another ten  minutes.    MALEE  I'll wait. Meet me by the cement  mixer when you're ready.    Malee walks off. Gus watches as she makes her way through  the construction site.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER AREA - TEN MINUTES LATER    Gus and Malee sit on a checkered blanket, eating Chinese food  with chopsticks. A large CEMENT MIXER stands behind them.          (CONTINUED)    37.  CONTINUED:    GUS  The last time I saw you, you had  just come from a funeral. How are  you doing?    MALEE  Okay. Death is like so weird. I  mean, it's sad, but I also feel  like I've been given this sign. A  sign which is telling me, life is  short, so you gotta do what makes  you happy. You gotta take chances.  You gotta get crazy.    GUS  What are you doing to \"get crazy\"?    MALEE  I play the flute.    GUS  (laughs)  Yeah, that's totally nuts.    MALEE  No, not that. See, every year my  school has this recital. I've  always been too scared to play a  solo in front of people, but this  year I've decided to do it.    GUS  Good for you. When is it?    MALEE  Why do you care?    GUS  Cause I'm gonna go.    MALEE  What? You can't go! Nobody goes  to these things. I don't even  think my mom is going.    GUS  You gotta have somebody rooting for  ya. Besides, I like music, and I  owe you for bringing me lunch.          (CONTINUED)    38.  CONTINUED: (2)    MALEE  (laughs, embarrassed)  Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the  junior high school auditorium.    GUS  I'll be there.    MALEE  (vulnerable)  Don't say it if you don't mean it.    GUS  I'll be there. Front row.    Malee smiles. She's got a major crush on Gus now.    CUT TO:    TIGHT ON TV: VIDEO GAME - HALO. Two soldiers fire at each  other with supersonic weapons. One soldier is particularly  annihilated. GAME OVER appears.    INT. CARGES LIVING ROOM. DAY    REVEAL Jacob and Leonard in front of the TV. Malee off to the  side, reading a book.    LEONARD  I can't believe how much you suck  at this game.    Jacob throws his remote down.    LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You wanna play again?    JACOB  No.    The boys sit in silence for a beat.    LEONARD  You wanna shoot some hoops?    JACOB  No.  (beat)  The sentencing thing totally upset  my mom. She was up half the night,  crying.        (CONTINUED)    39.  CONTINUED:    Malee closes her book, looks over at Leanord.    LEONARD  I can't believe it either. A year  ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever.    JACOB  I want them dead. I want to kill  them. I could handle a year in  Juvy hall.    MALEE  Whoa, what those guys did was an  accident. If you were to kill  them, it's premedicated. You'd get  20 years to life at least.    JACOB  So I'm just supposed to sit here  and take it? Be like you guys.    LEONARD  What is that supposed to mean?    JACOB  You seem to have gone on with life  pretty easily. Don't you miss him?  Don't you care?    MALEE  It's not that we don't care. It's  just...    JACOB  Life goes on.    MALEE  It does. You have to deal with it.  If you don't, it could like eat you  alive forever. 90 percent of  people's problems is due to their  inability to get over the past.    LEONARD  How do you know?    MALEE  My mom tells that to all her  patients. I've eavesdropped on  some of her therapy sessions.          (CONTINUED)    40.  CONTINUED: (2)    LEONARD  That's awesome. Can I listen in  sometime?    MALEE  No. Anyway, she says, if a person  wants closure, they gotta deal with  their problems head on. Go see  these guys and let them know how  you feel.    JACOB  I don't think my parents would be  up for that.    MALEE  Go alone. Juvy hall is only like  forty minutes from here. Take the  bus.    Off Jacob, thinking-    INT. JACOB'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON    The bedroom door slowly opens. Jacob peeks his head inside  the darkened room and quietly enters. He tip toes over to  his parent's bed. Ashley lies asleep, wrapped up in a bundle  of blankets.    Jacob crosses to her night stand and opens the top drawer.  He removes her purse, unzips it and steals some cash, which  totals around 60 dollars.    INT. CARGES LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER    Jim sits in his chair, staring off into space. Jacob enters  and crosses to the front door.    JACOB  Bye, Dad.    EXT. BUS STATION - MOMENTS LATER    With the help of the BUS DRIVER, Jacob loads his bike into  the luggage compartment underneath the bus. Then he hands  the driver a ticket and boards.    Jacob takes a seat up front. After a few moments, the driver  boards, starts the engine and drives off.    41.        INT. JUVINILE HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - LATER    Jacob and Kenny sit, staring at each other through a plate of  glass. Kenny picks up the ONE WAY PHONE. Jacob does also.    JACOB  Where's Jeff?    KENNY  He's sick. I think he...    JACOB  (interrupting)  I hate you. You know that? You  bastard.    KENNY  Rudy knew we were going to be  there. He never should have come.  You want the truth, all this  happened cause of you.    JACOB  Me?    KENNY  Yeah, you deformed retard! The  only reason we started picking on  you guys in the first place was  because of that thing on your face.    JACOB  Every night, I lie in bed and plan  your murder.    KENNY  I'm shaking.    JACOB  First I'm going to take a kitchen  knife and chop off your fingers  then your nose then your tongue.  Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes  with the end of a broomstick.  Well, not really poke them out, but  I'm gonna push them back into your  brain. Then I'm gonna take  scissors and cut off your ears.  When they find you, it's gonna be  like putting a jigsaw puzzle back  together.        (CONTINUED)    42.  CONTINUED:    KENNY  If you kill me, you come here.    JACOB  So? What do I have to look forward  to? You've already destroyed my  life.    KENNY  What happened was an accident.    JACOB  There are no accidents. You're  gonna pay for what you did. And  it's gonna hurt like hell.    INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT    Leonard sits, reading through nutritional manuals.    We see that he is writing things down on a piece of paper.  The words written are: Sugar, corn syrup, salt, gum.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - HALLWAY/KITCHEN - LATER    Grace walks through the hallway half asleep. She enters the  kitchen and finds Leonard, sitting on the floor, surrounded  by boxes of food. All of the kitchen cupboards are open and  packages line the counter tops.    GRACE  What the hell is this?    LEONARD  I'm reading the list of ingredients  in our foods.    GRACE  Why?    LEONARD  Research. Do you know the damage  these chemicals can do to the human  body?    GRACE  Leonard, put everything back.    LEONARD  This is serious. You can't keep  buying this crap. Don't you care  that you're ingesting garbage?      (CONTINUED)    43.  CONTINUED:    GRACE  Just put everything back and go to  sleep.    Off Leonard's look -    EXT. STREET - NEXT DAY - AFTERNOON    Malee is riding her bike on the sidewalk when she sees Gus,  exit his car and enter her mother's office.    INT. STAIRWELL/HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER    Malee runs up a flight of stairs. She gets off at the second  floor and enters an open, unoccupied office.    INT. UNOCCUPIED OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    Malee runs over to the heating grate and puts her ear to it.    YACCO (FROM BELOW)  How was your week?    GUS (FROM BELOW)  Same. Still can't sleep. When I  do, nightmares.    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - SAME TIME    Yacco and Gus sit across from each other.    YACCO  Post traumatic stress is very  common in your line of work. Many  fire fighters go through this.    GUS  Yeah. But why now? I haven't  fought fires in ten years.    YACCO  Sometimes we experience something  so horrific, our memory blocks it  out. That way we won't have to  relive the pain. It's called  repression. Our bodies are not so  forgiving, however. Inside, we  feel the effects of trauma even  when we don't know why.    GUS  What does that mean?      (CONTINUED)    44.  CONTINUED:    YACCO  Something stirred your unconscious.  If we find out what that was, we  can begin the healing process.    Gus looks to her, confused.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You told me last week, the  nightmares started about the time  you moved here. Let's look at  that. Why did you move here?    GUS  A friend was making good money with  construction. He got an offer to  build that extension off Lindsay  Acres. He suggested I come into  town and work for a while.    INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME    Malee is on the edge of her seat, listening. We see that she  has written the following words in her notebook: GUS -  NIGHTMARES - FIRE.    YACCO (FROM BELOW)  Are there any other reoccurring  elements in your dreams. Perhaps,  a face or...    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - SAME TIME    GUS  \"Light my Fire\" is always playing.    YACCO  What?    GUS  Light my fire. The Doors song.  (singing)  \"Da da something... wallow in the  mire... Da, da... we couldn't get  much higher. Come on baby light my  fire.    Yacco stares at Gus. He is suddenly self conscious.    YACCO  Interesting.    45.        INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - SAME TIME    Malee circles the words \"Light My Fire\" again and again and  again.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAYS LATER - EVENING    SFX: CLANGING POTS AND PANS, coming from downstairs.    Jacob exits his room and goes to inspect the noise.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER    Jim stands on a chair, cleaning out the kitchen cupboards.    Pots and pans line the counter tops, dishes cover the table  and non perishable foods are spread out across the floor.    Jacob enters and is taken aback by the sight of Jim standing  on a chair and wearing an APRON and RUBBER GLOVES.    JACOB  Dad?    JIM  Jacob.    JACOB  You okay?    JIM  Fantastic.    Jim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth.    JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You know, for the past few weeks, I  sat in this house. I couldn't  move. Everything reminded me of  Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I  had a revelation. I am alive!  Your mother is alive! I became  overcome with joy because I  realized how lucky we are to still  have you.    JACOB  Me?    JIM  Jacob. I love you.        (CONTINUED)    46.  CONTINUED:    Jim grabs Jacob and hugs him tightly. Jacob pulls away,  unsettled and bit frightened.    JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd)  (half crazed)  I went to work today. For the  first time in weeks. It was as if  I had just gotten out of college!  I was fearless! I went after  accounts I had avoided for years  because I thought they were out of  my league. I spoke to presidents,  vice presidents, business managers,  sales reps. I was amazing. I was  magic. But when I came home to  share the news with your mother, I  discovered her asleep. When I  looked around the house, I realized  that her \"office\", for lack of a  better word, was also piled up.  So, I took to the house. I have  made it my duty to clean this place  from top to bottom. Even if it  takes me all night, I don't care.  Jacob?    JACOB  (frightened)  Yeah?    JIM  Will you join me? Join me in this  celebration of life. A symbolic  gesture of cleaning out the old and  bringing in the new.    JACOB  Do I have to?    JIM  (thrown for a loop)  No, you don't have to.    JACOB  Good night, Dad.    Off Jim's look -    EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAYS LATER - NIGHT    Parents and students file inside. A large SIGN above the  door reads, JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH FALL RECITAL.    47.        INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS    A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center  stage and singing \"The Rose\". She is not nearly as good as  she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle.    We FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along  with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row,  but Gus is no where to be found.    The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds.    Mr. Farmer crosses to the microphone.    MR. FARMER  I'm sure Bette Midler would be most  impressed with that rendition.    The crowd laughs. Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a  joke.    MR. FARMER (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Anyway, our next soloist is Malee  Chung. She will play the theme  from \"Love Story\" on the flute.    The crowd applauds as Malee rises and crosses to the  microphone.    MALEE  Thank you, Mr. Farmer.    Malee spots Gus, walking down the aisle. He scurries into  the front row and sits. Malee lights up.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  There's actually been a change.  I'm not going to play the theme  from \"Love Story\". Um... this is a  song...    Mr. Farmer, waves to Malee from off stage. Malee looks at  him. Mr. Farmer mouths something to her.    MALEE (INTO MICROPHONE) (CONT'D)  (to Mr. Farmer)  What? I can't hear you?    Mr. Farmer throws up his hands.          (CONTINUED)    48.  CONTINUED:    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Anyway. This is a song by The  Doors.    At the mention of The Doors, Gus' smile instantly fades. The  coincidence is just too great.    Malee starts to play \"Light My Fire\". She is good. Mr.  Farmer and the audience seem pleased by her euphonious  performance. Even Gus is won over. He appears entranced by  the music.    INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT    The recital is over. Most of the audience has filed out. A  few remain, offering their congratulations to the musicians.    Malee stands with Leonard.    MALEE  Where's Jacob?    LEONARD  Couldn't make it. He...    GUS (O.S.)  Malee.    Malee spots Gus, heading towards her.    MALEE  Oh my God! He's coming over.    LEONARD  Who?    MALEE  Shut up! Leave now.    Malee pushes Leonard behind her just as Gus approaches.    GUS  You were awesome.    MALEE  Really? Be honest. I'd rather you  tell me I sucked then lie.    GUS  You were great.    Leonard peeks around Malee's back.      (CONTINUED)    49.  CONTINUED:    MALEE  Excuse me for a second.    Malee turns around and pinches Leonard.    LEONARD  Ow, ow, ow alright. I'm going.    Leonard walks off. Malee turns back around with a big smile  on her face. She plays coy.    MALEE  So you really enjoyed it?    GUS  Yeah. Good song. What made you  pick it?    MALEE  (covering)  Oh, uh... my mother was humming it  all last week. Big Doors fan.    GUS  Really? Is she here?    MALEE  No.    GUS  She missed out.    MALEE  You're so sweet.    GUS  Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks  again. I had a great time.    Gus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks  off. Malee melts. She stands frozen, clutching onto her  flute in ecstacy.    EXT. STREET - MORNING    With fire and determination, Leonard jogs. Unfortunately, he  is quickly winded by the run. He bends over, gasping.    SUPERIMPOSE SHOT OVER SHOT: Leonard appears, running past  his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards  and then is forced to stop.        (CONTINUED)    50.  CONTINUED:  He leans over for air, and we SUPERIMPOSE another SHOT OVER  SHOT of Leonard, weeks later, running past his weaker self.  (This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating  the progression of time and weight loss.)    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - STAIRCASE/KITCHEN - DAY    Leonard runs up and down the stairs, sweating like crazy.    Grace appears, watching him around the corner. She shakes  her head and then returns to the kitchen.    GRACE  That boy is going to bring the  entire house down.    PATRICK  Let him be. He's looking good.  I'm proud of him.    GRACE  (to the girls)  Girls, have you decided what you're  going to go as for Halloween?    SARA  Either a witch or a princess.    GRACE  That's nice. Haley?    HALEY  I'm going to go as a marble.    GRACE  What do you mean, a marble?    HALEY  You know, like a bag of marbles,  but just one marble.    INT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTHS - LATE AFTERNOON    Jacob and Jeff sit across from each other on the phone. Jeff  has two black eyes and a fat lip. He is crying profusely.  Jacob doesn't appear at all sympathetic.    JEFF  I'm really sorry, man. I...          (CONTINUED)    51.  CONTINUED:    JACOB  You just think about what I said.  Get out of my sight. And send  Kenny in on your way out.    Jeff rises and walks to a door, leading to the jail. A  moment later, Kenny enters, looking pissed off. He sits  across from Jacob and picks up the phone.    KENNY  What did you say to him?    JACOB  I thought you'd both like to know  that Halloween was Rudy's favorite  holiday.    Jacob picks up some pictures and presses them against the  glass.    JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)  These are pictures from every  single Halloween since we were  five. You see how happy he was?    KENNY  Stop it.    JACOB  After we'd go trick or treating,  we'd sit in our room and swap the  candy we hated. Rudy loved  Snickers, I Almond Joys.    KENNY  Almond Joy sucks.    JACOB  What sucks is that I'll never get  to sit in my room and swap candy  with my brother ever again. Thanks  to you.    KENNY  Why are you doing this?    JACOB  To remind you.          (CONTINUED)    52.  CONTINUED: (2)    KENNY  How could we forget? You been  coming here for months to \"remind  us\".    JACOB  No one is forcing you to talk to  me.    KENNY  Anything to get out of my cell.    JACOB  Is your cell small?    KENNY  Yes.    JACOB  So is a coffin.    KENNY  You're not the only one who wishes  he was still alive. I'd do  anything to bring him back, but I  can't. It's not easy being in  here. Hell, you saw Jeff.    JACOB  What happened to him?    KENNY  He pissed off the wrong guy off.  Jeff is totally fucked right now.    JACOB  Good.    KENNY  Don't come back here ever again.    JACOB  Free country. I'll come if I want.    KENNY  Don't expect me to show up.    Kenny slams down the phone and exits. Jacob smiles, having  shaken him.    53.        INT. LEONARD'S HOME - FRONT DOOR - THAT NIGHT    Grace hands out candy to a few trick or treaters at her door.    GRACE  Be careful now. Have a good night.    INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS    Grace crosses to the kitchen table where Pat is doing a  crossword puzzle.    GRACE  Kids keep coming later every year.    SFX: FRONT DOOR, opening and closing.    Haley and Sara storm into the kitchen in tears. Haley is  dressed as a MARBLE, and Sara is dressed as a WITCH.    HALEY  I hate him! I hate him!    GRACE  Who? What happened?    HALEY  Leonard! He threw away all our  Halloween candy.    GRACE/PATRICK  What?    SARA  He grabbed our bags and just threw  them down a gutter.    Leonard enters. Haley and Sara run out of the kitchen.    PATRICK  What the hell is going on? Why did  you throw away their candy?    LEONARD  Because their sugar intake is  completely unhealthy. Besides,  Halloween is supposed to be a  celebration of evil. How did candy  get wrapped into it?          (CONTINUED)    54.  CONTINUED:    GRACE  I am going to ask you this once,  and I want a straight answer. Are  you in a cult?    PATRICK  Grace!    GRACE  This is what happens when kids join  cults. The first thing they change  is their diets.    LEONARD  I'm not in a cult. This is all  information you can find in books.    GRACE  The issue here is that you have  stolen one of the most exciting  nights of the year from your  sisters.    PATRICK  If anybody had done this to you  when you were a child, we never  would have heard the end of it.    LEONARD  I wish somebody had done it to me.  I wish either one of you had given  a shit about my weight.    Leonard storms out of the kitchen. Patrick and Grace are  speechless.    INT. LEONARD'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER    Leonard lies on the floor, doing sit-ups. He can actually do  a few now. Patrick bursts into the room.    PATRICK  I do not care for your language.    LEONARD  I'm only trying to help you guys.    Leonard stops exercising.    LEONARD (cont'd)  You're fat dad. Mom is fat. Us  kids are fat.      (CONTINUED)    55.  CONTINUED:    PATRICK  What's your point?    LEONARD  Dad, you and mom are going to die  young if you keep eating as poorly  as you do.    PATRICK  What is this obsession you have  with weight?    LEONARD  The coach for Jefferson High is  also my gym teacher. He told me  that if I got into shape, I could  start as center for the Freshman  team when I get to high school.    PATRICK  Center is a great position.  Toughest guy on the field. A good  center can make or break a team.    LEONARD  I know. That's why I'm trying so  hard to get into shape. You guys  should to. At the rate you're  going, you won't make it to your  60's.    PATRICK  Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a  tasty meal is just a way of showing  she cares.    LEONARD  She doesn't! Tonight she served  spaghetti and meatballs from a can.  The amount of sodium alone can  wreck havoc on a person's blood  pressure. Not to mention...    PATRICK  Leonard, people just don't drop  dead from eating meatballs.    Off Leonard's look -    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON    Malee hands Gus her bag of Halloween Candy.      (CONTINUED)    56.  CONTINUED:    GUS  I can't take your Halloween candy.    MALEE  You'll be doing me a favor.  Chocolate gives you zits. Besides,  if I want to keep this firm ass as  an adult, I gotta develop good  eating habits now.    GUS  (uncomfortable)  Maybe just a snickers.    Gus opens a snickers bar and starts eating.    MALEE  So work is good?    GUS  To be honest, I can't wait till  this job is finished. This place  is creepy. You know, a boy died  here like right before we started  working.    MALEE  Rudy. His name was Rudy.    GUS  You knew him?    MALEE  He was one of my best friends.  Remember that funeral I went to?    GUS  That was him?    MALEE  I thought you knew. Two boys threw  a flaming cocktail at him. Can you  imagine killing someone like that?  How evil can you get?    Gus eyes Malee, completely unsettled.    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT    Obviously drunk, Gus stumbles to his front door. He fumbles  for his keys and enters.    57.        INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER    Gus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a  GUN in the other. Distraught and at the point of tears, Gus  opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet.    Then he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to  his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the  room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's  gone.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING    Ashley stands with a big smile on her face.    ASHLEY  Jeff Laskey is dead.    Jim and Jacob look up, stunned.    JIM  What?    ASHLEY  He committed suicide in his jail  cell last night. Sally Yngve  called just now to tell me.    Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as  Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the  kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins  eating. She is smiling.    JACOB  Why are you smiling? A boy died.    ASHLEY  No, a monster that murdered my son  died. Justice is served; end of  story.    Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves  and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss  as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.    INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTH - LATER THAT NIGHT    Jacob and Kenny are on the phone together. Kenny looks gaunt  and tired. Jeff's death has obviously affected him.          (CONTINUED)    58.  CONTINUED:    KENNY  He used his bed sheet, waited until  lights out and then jumped.    JACOB  That's terrible.    KENNY  His cell mate let him hang there  the entire night.    JACOB  I'm sorry, Kenny.    KENNY  Like you even give a shit. I bet  when you heard, you started  dancing.    JACOB  No.    KENNY  I knew he wouldn't make it. It's  my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint  when I met him, but he sure as hell  wasn't headed here.  (tearing up)  That fucking asshole!    Kenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms. Jacob  watches through the glass, touched by Kenny's reaction.    MUSIC OVER SHOT: UPBEAT CHRISTMAS MUSIC    INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING    Jacob sits on the floor, surrounded by boxes and wrapping  paper. Santa has obviously been good to him.    Jim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep.    Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the  fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it.  She is a drastically different woman than the last time we  saw her. She looks upbeat and pretty.    JACOB  An IPOD! Sweet!    Ashley looks at Jacob and smiles. He has just unwrapped an  IPOD.      (CONTINUED)    59.  CONTINUED:    ASHLEY  You like it?    JACOB  I love it. You guys went crazy  this year.    Ashley smiles at her son. It's a bittersweet moment for her.    JIM  I'm going to shower.    ASHLEY  Jim, Jacob still has one more  present.    JIM  I thought we were going to wait.    JACOB  No, do it now! Now!    Ashley crosses to the couch and sits beside Jim. They hold  each others hands.    ASHLEY  After serious debate, your father  and I have decided... to adopt A  BABY!    JACOB  What?    JIM  We're gonna adopt a baby.  Hopefully a boy.    Off Jacob's shock -    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY    Leonard's extended family sits at the kitchen table, eating  Christmas dinner. His extended family is just as overweight  as his immediate. Leonard barely touches his own plate, too  disgusted to eat. He rises.    LEONARD  May I be excused?    The entire family stops eating and turns to him.          (CONTINUED)    60.  CONTINUED:    GRACE  No!    Leonard sits back down. His family quickly resumes eating.    INT. MALEE'S HOME - DEN - EVENING    Malee does her homework, Yacoo flips through a fashion  magazine.    MALEE  Why do I have to do this? It's  Christmas break.    YACCO  You'll be one step ahead in  January.    MALEE  Just because you're an atheist, I  don't get to celebrate the  holidays.    Yacco shoots Malee the look of death.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Don't you find it hard not  believing in anything?    YACCO  Malee.    MALEE  I'm going for a bike ride.    YACCO  There's a foot of snow outside.    MALEE  The streets are ploughed. Besides,  I like looking at all the lights.    YACCO  Be home in an hour. Be careful.    EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT    Malee flips through a TELEPHONE BOOK. She comes to Gus' name  and rips out the page.    61.        INT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - OUTSIDE HIS DOOR - LATER    Malee knocks on Gus' door, but he doesn't answer. Then Malee  spots a WELCOME MAT. She kicks it aside and discovers a  SPARE KEY underneath.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS    Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A  beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your  typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every  shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old  couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen.    INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS    Malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room.  Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER    Malee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed. Its  unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball.  Aroused, Malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy.    EXT. FRONT OF GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME    Gus drives up, parks along the sidewalk, and gets out.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Malee goes through a photo album. We see pictures of Gus,  dressed in a firefighter's uniform. He appears much younger  and clean cut.    As Malee returns the album to the night stand, she notices a  an open drawer and peeks inside.    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - SAME TIME    Gus lazily makes his way upstairs.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Malee holds Gus' gun. Complete with sound effects, she  pretends to shoot a beer bottle off the dresser.    Malee laughs and then jumps across the bed like a Charlie's  Angel.    62.        INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - GUS'S FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME    Gus fumbles for his keys.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Malee stands in front of the mirror, posing.    MALEE  Freeze! That's right.    Malee laughs in spite of herself. In the process, she  unknowingly cocks the trigger. Malee places the gun to her  forehead and pretends to shoot herself.    TIGHT ON TRIGGER, a hair away from firing -    SFX: BAM!    INT. GUS' APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME    The loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut. Gus  opens it and inspects the door frame.    INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN/BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER    Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his  bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some  one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found.    Gus begins getting undressed. We follow his shirt to the  floor and SEE Malee, hiding underneath his bed.    SFX: FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENING, SHOWER RUNNING    Malee looks out from underneath the bed. She watches as the  now naked Gus enters the shower stall in the bathroom.    As the water falls upon Gus, Malee rises from underneath the  bed and crosses over to him.    INT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS    From over Gus's shoulder, we see Malee approaching. An inch  away from Gus, Malee reaches out her hand to touch him.  Suddenly, Gus breaks down and starts crying.    Unsettled, Malee slowly retreats out of the bathroom.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - NEXT DAY    Malee, Leonard and Jacob sit, playing LIFE, the board game.      (CONTINUED)    63.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  Don't worry, white male infants are  the hardest to come by. 60 minutes  did a whole story on it.    MALEE  Since when do you watch 60 minutes?    LEONARD  Since I was in the hospital. They  said, any adoption agency worth its  salt has at least a three year  waiting list. By the time your  parents get a kid, you'll be in  college. You think they'll want to  start over again with that baby  shit?    JACOB  No, but it's like they're trying to  replace Rudy.    LEONARD  It doesn't matter cause it's not  gonna happen.    Malee has been silent this entire time. Seeing a moment, she  speaks up.    MALEE  I'm thirsty.  (to Leanard)  Can you get us some drinks?    LEONARD  Why me?    MALEE  Because it's the gentlemanly thing  to do.    JACOB  I'll get the drinks.    MALEE  I'll go with you.    LEONARD  Why are you all of a sudden going  to get the drinks?          (CONTINUED)    64.  CONTINUED: (2)    MALEE  (bitchy)  Because you've upset me, and I  don't want to see you right now.    Leonard looks to Jacob.    LEONARD  Fine, I'll get the drinks.    Leonard exits. Malee turns to Jacob.    MALEE  I need a favor. It's big. I need  you to hide something for me.    JACOB  Hide what?    Malee reaches into her back pack.    MALEE  Promise, you won't freak.    JACOB  I won't.    Malee removes Gus' gun.    JACOB (cont'd)  Holy shit!    MALEE  You said, you wouldn't freak!    JACOB  That's a gun.    MALEE  I know.    JACOB  Where'd you get it?    MALEE  I can't tell you. I just need you  to hide it for a while. When all  is cool, I'll come for it.    JACOB  Why can't you keep it?        (CONTINUED)    65.  CONTINUED: (3)    MALEE  My mother is a total snoop. She  goes through my stuff like all the  time.  (beat)  Please, Jacob. Somebody's life  might depend on it.    Jacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and  opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside.    JACOB  Is it loaded?    MALEE  No, but I do have some bullets.    Malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets.  Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Sure your parents won't find it?    JACOB  Nobody has the combination, but me.  Besides, I could be building a bomb  in here, and they wouldn't even  know.    Off Jacob, locking the box up.    FADE TO BLACK:    FADE IN:    EXT. STREET - MONTHS LATER - MORNING    ON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once  skin tight sweat suit, hangs off of him. More than just  skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully  avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the  horizon.)    INT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - NEXT DAY    Jacob and Kenny talk via one way phone. Their demeanor has  changed since last we saw them. No longer fraught with  contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends.    JACOB  I sent in some comics for ya. The  X-men one is pretty sweet.      (CONTINUED)    66.  CONTINUED:    KENNY  That last batch was awesome.    Jacob checks his watch.    JACOB  I better get going, I don't want to  miss my bus.    KENNY  Before you go, I got some news.  Apparently, the parole board feels  I've been a model prisoner, so  they're giving me early release.    JACOB  What? How can they do that?    KENNY  I don't know. They just did.  You're pissed, aren't you? I knew  you would be.  (off Jacob's silence)  It was an accident, Jacob.    JACOB  So you're getting out. Gonna head  back to school, or...    KENNY  Fuck school. I'm going to live  with my Dad in New Mexico. He's  working on a ranch out there.    JACOB  You can't leave the state. That  violates your probation. You'll  have to...    KENNY  My dad won't tell anyone. No one  will even care I'm out there.    JACOB  Your mom will.    KENNY  Jacob, in the entire time I've been  locked up, you were the only one  who came to see me. Trust me, she  won't care.    67.        INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON    Malee fans out a fist full of twenty dollar bills.    MALEE  200 dollars! Dad sent me 200  dollars!    Yacco, smiling, gets ready for work.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I have to call him.    YACCO  No!  (covering)  Your father... went out. He's not  home right now.    Malee eyes her mother, suspicious.    MALEE  You're acting weird. What's going  on?    YACCO  Nothing.    MALEE  Well, do you want to come with me  to the mall and spend it?    YACCO  I'd prefer it if you'd put that  money in the bank.  (off Malee's look)  Fine, spend it. You'll have to do  it alone though. I have a patient  this afternoon. Have a good day.    Yacco exits the kitchen. Malee looks at her cash and smiles.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME    Leonard, Patrick and Grace sit at the kitchen table.    PATRICK  Here's the deal. You know how my  company flies me to Florida every  April?          (CONTINUED)    68.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  You and I have been going since I  was eight. It's the guy's week  off.    PATRICK  This year, I'm taking the girls.  Just the girls. You're staying  home.    LEONARD  Why can't we all go?    GRACE  I'm not staying here all alone.  Besides, you said it yourself,  you've been going for years. Give  your sisters a chance.    Leonard eyes his mother with hatred.    LEONARD  Whatever.  (beat)  I need money.    PATRICK  What for?    LEONARD  Clothes. Nothing I have fits  anymore.    GRACE  Your father and I aren't rich. You  can't get a new wardrobe anytime  you want.    LEONARD  What am I supposed to do, go to  school naked?    GRACE  Wear a belt.    PATRICK  I'll give him some cash, he can get  some clothes.    GRACE  No. He's gonna gain all his weight  back in a few months.  (MORE)    (CONTINUED)    69.  CONTINUED: (2)  GRACE (cont'd)  Then what, we have to buy him new  clothes all over again?    Obviously hurt, Leonard storms out of the kitchen.    PATRICK  Grace.    GRACE  What? It's true.    Grace exits the kitchen.    JACOB (O.S.)  I thought you hated going to  Florida?    EXT. JACOB'S FRONT LAWN - LATER    Leonard and Jacob play catch with a football.    LEONARD  When I was fat. Now I don't have  to wear a T-shirt when I go  swimming. Who knows, maybe I could  even get lucky.    JACOB  You're still ugly, though.    Leonard punches Jacob's arm in fun.    LEONARD  I don't understand what my mother's  problem is. It's like the thinner  I get, the more she hates me.    JACOB  She's probably jealous. Maybe you  should put her on that diet.    LEONARD  Anytime I mention it, my mother  goes crazy.    JACOB  If you really want her to drop a  few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's  lost about 30 pounds since he's  been incarcerated, and he was  already thin.          (CONTINUED)    70.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  Really?    JACOB  Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight  loss program. You take a fat tub,  throw them in a room and force them  to eat right and exercise. Don't  let them out till they do.    Off Leonard, thinking-    INT. MALEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT    Yacco enters Malee's room.    YACCO  Malee, dinner!    Yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn  everywhere.    YACCO (cont'd)  Malee?  (noticing something)  Oh my God!    REVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the  gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed  into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced  by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin  length curls.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What did you do?    MALEE  I got a new look. You know, for  Spring. What do you think?    Malee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture.    YACCO  You look...    MALEE  Beautiful?    YACCO  Different. What happened to your  glasses?        (CONTINUED)    71.  CONTINUED:    MALEE  Contacts. It took me like forty  five minutes to get them in, but  beauty is pain.    YACCO  Honey, in the future, I'd like to  know if you're going to radically  change your appearance. Clean your  stuff up and come down for dinner.    Yacco exits. Malee looks in the mirror, deflated.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - AFTERNOON    Gus watches a CEMENT TRUCK, dumping cement into a foundation.  Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is  revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket.    Gus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time. His  jaw drops.    GUS  Malee? My God, you look...    MALEE  Different?    GUS  Beautiful. You look beautiful.    Off Malee's smile -    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER AREA - LATER    Gus and Malee eat their lunch.    MALEE  I felt like I needed a change, you  know?    GUS  I bet you're driving the boys at  school wild.    MALEE  Boys my age are so immature. I'm  more attracted to older gentlemen.    Malee smiles at Gus. He knows where this is going, and he's  suddenly nervous.        (CONTINUED)    72.  CONTINUED:    GUS  You don't want somebody that much  older than you. An age difference  can cause problems.    MALEE  What kind of problems?    GUS  A lot of times when a couple has an  age difference, they wind up  splitting up because they want  different things.    MALEE  You mean sex.    GUS  No.    Gus catches a look of relief on Malee's face.    GUS (cont'd)  I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a  boy even three years older than you  is probably more \"experienced\".  Boys can be impatient about that  sort of thing.    MALEE  Are you impatient?    GUS  No, but when I was a kid.    MALEE  Why don't you have a girlfriend?    GUS  I did, but it didn't work out.    MALEE  How old was she?    GUS  About my age.    MALEE  See that, age wasn't an issue, yet  you still wanted different things.  I don't think it's about age.  (MORE)      (CONTINUED)    73.  CONTINUED: (2)  MALEE (cont'd)  I think when two people connect,  they connect for other reasons.  And since soulmates are eternal,  they have no age.    Gus is stumped.    EXT. LEONARD'S DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY    Leonard watches Patrick and his sisters drive off in a  TAXICAB.    LEONARD  (calling after them)  Have a good flight!    The taxicab disappears down the street.    As Leonard turns back around, he sees Grace, staring at him  from the window. They lock eyes for a moment and then Grace  disappears into the dark recesses of the home.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT    Leonard descends the staircase and begins looking around at  the setting. Boxes of junk clutter the floor along with old  furniture and bicycles.    He crosses to the basement door, which leads out to the  backyard. As Leonard unlocks and opens the door, a mass of  cobwebs stretch across the frame like elastic bands. Leonard  grabs a nearby broom and starts wiping away the cobwebs.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - DAYS LATER    Jacob sits at his desk, reading the PLASTIC SURGERY PAMPHLET  his parents had given him for his birthday last year.    The bedroom door opens and Ashley sticks her head in.    ASHLEY  We're home.    JACOB  Hi.    ASHLEY  Could you come downstairs for a  minute. We have a surprise for  you.    74.        INT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER    Jacob stands in front of KEITH GARDNER (10), African  American, sweet faced and dressed in a shirt and tie. He has  luggage with him.    Ashley and Jim stand behind the boys, beaming.    JIM  This is Keith Gardner. You're new  brother. Keith our son, Jacob.    Keith extends his hand.    KEITH  It's nice to meet you.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER    Jacob leads Keith inside.    JACOB  You get top bunk.    KEITH  I'm kind of afraid of heights.    JACOB  Sucks to be you.    Keith lets Jacob's attitude pass.    JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)  No offence, but I never thought my  future brother would be a... well,  a \"brother\".    KEITH  I never thought my future brother  would have a KOOL AID stain,  smeared across his face.    JACOB  Fuck you, it's a birthmark!    KEITH  We're getting off on the wrong  foot.          (CONTINUED)    75.  CONTINUED:    JACOB  When my parents said they were  taking in an orphan, I pictured a  baby. So what happened, your  parents die or something?    KEITH  I was given up at birth.    JACOB  You gonna try and find your mother  when you're 18?    KEITH  As far as I'm concerned, the fact  she had me was enough. I don't  need to show up one day and disrupt  her life.    JACOB  Oh, but it's okay to just show up  one day and disrupt mine?    Off Keith's hurt look -    INT. LIBRARY - LATER    Malee stands at the card catalogue, flipping through the \"S\"  section. She comes to cards with the word SEX in the title.    INT. MALEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING    Malee enters her room, locks the door behind her and empties  her bag of SEX books on the bed. The first one she peruses  is the \"KARMA SUTRA\". At first glance, Malee's eyes go wide  in shock. She grabs her backpack and removes a number of  index cards. Malee starts taking notes.    INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTHS - NEXT DAY    Jacob is on the one way phone with Kenny.    JACOB  He's not some baby. He's like 10.    KENNY  You're blaming me for this?    JACOB  No. But can you believe it?          (CONTINUED)    76.  CONTINUED:    KENNY  Maybe this is the only way they can  get over Rudy's death.    JACOB  He's a person not a fucking vase.    KENNY  I know.    JACOB  I gotta get out of there. I can't  live in that house for one more  day. I want to go with you to New  Mexico.    KENNY  No way. You've never even been  out on the road.    JACOB  So.    KENNY  It's not easy. After first night  falls, you'll be pissing yourself.    JACOB  No, I won't.    KENNY  You don't need me to run away from  home.    JACOB  That's not what this is about.    KENNY  Yes, it is.  (beat)  And you want to come with ME of all  people. Are you forgetting, I was  the one who killed Rudy!    JACOB  That was an accident.    Kenny appears stunned. Jacob has never accepted that truth.          (CONTINUED)    77.  CONTINUED: (2)    JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)  I'll be helpful. I can get  everything we'll need together. As  soon as you're released, we can go.    Kenny appears to be weighing the decision.    JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Please.    KENNY  If this is what you want. Alright.    INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME    Yacco is on the phone with her ex-husband.    YACCO (INTO PHONE)  ... I'm not asking for much. Just  call her from time to time...  Because she needs to know her  father cares... Call collect.    Malee enters the kitchen.    MALEE  Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?    YACCO  Take some responsibility for  yourself and grow... Hello?...    Yacco slams the phone down.    YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd)  He hung up.    MALEE  Well, what do you expect? All you  ever do is yell at him.    YACCO  Malee, you don't understand.    MALEE  He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it  bothers you, but I love him. You  keep this up then one day, when I'm  old enough, I'll leave here and go  and stay with him.    Malee runs out of the room, leaving a disappointed Yacco.    78.        INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT    Leonard hammers a piece of wood over the basement door, which  is now entirely boarded up.    REVEAL the basement. Now clean. Boxes, furniture and trash  are piled neatly in a corner. Only a mattress remains on the  floor in the center of the room.    Leonard grabs a grocery bag and crosses to a bathroom at the  opposite end of the basement.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS    Leonard turns on the light, revealing a shower, toilet and  sink. He removes toiletries from the grocery bag and places  them inside.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - DEN - SAME TIME    Grace watches FAMILY FEUD while eating cake.    LEONARD (O.S.)  (screaming)  Help! Oh God, Ma! Help!    Grace drops her fork.    GRACE  Leonard?    Grace jumps up and runs out of the room.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS    Grace opens the door to the staircase, which leads to the  basement.    GRACE  (screaming)  Leonard, what's wrong?    LEONARD (O.S.)  It's on top of me. I can't get up!  Oh, there's so much blood!    GRACE  I'm calling 9-1-1!    LEONARD (O.S.)  Get it off me first! I'm bleeding.        (CONTINUED)    79.  CONTINUED:    GRACE  If I go downstairs, I won't be able  to make it back up. Let me call  9-1-1 first, okay?    Leonard doesn't answer her.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard?    Silence.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Oh, Jesus!    Grace begins walking downstairs. Due to her size, she has  difficultly maneuvering through the tight space. Her  inability to see her feet isn't helping matters.    Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard?    Suddenly, Leonard bursts through the bathroom door with a  hammer in hand. He runs past Grace and up the stairs.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What the hell?    Half way up the stairs, Leonard stops and pries two of the  steps off the stair case with his hammer. This creates a  GAP, making it virtually impossible for Grace to ascend.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What are you doing? I can't climb  up now!    Leonard runs upstairs and slams the door after him.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard! Leonard!    EXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME    Malee watches as Gus enters his car and drives off.    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER    Malee crosses to Gus' door with a GROCERY BAG in hand. She  kicks the welcome mat aside, picks up the spare key and  enters.    80.        INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS    Malee enters and removes a pair of rubber gloves, a bottle of  ammonia and trash bags. She starts cleaning.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - LATER THAT DAY    Leonard descends the staircase, holding a tray of food.    Grace instantly rises.    LEONARD  I hope someone is hungry.    GRACE  Get me out of here now!    LEONARD  No joke, Ma. For the next two  weeks while Dad and the girls are  away, you will be kept down here.  I'll provide you with nutritious  meals and plenty of water. You,  mother, will learn what it means to  be healthy.    GRACE  That's what this is about, food?    LEONARD  I'm trying to save your life, mom.  Trying to give you a life. Cause I  love you.    GRACE  My life is fine. I don't need you  to \"save me\".    Leonard looks at his mother, sympathetic.    LEONARD  You don't even realize how sick you  are. It's a problem when an  otherwise healthy woman can't drag  her ass up a flight of stairs  because she's so obese. You're  staying down here.    Leonard turns and crosses back to the staircase.    LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Oh, and no cigarettes either.    81.        INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING    The kitchen is now spotless. Malee removes TWO TV DINNERS  from the oven. She crosses over to the kitchen table and  places the food onto plates.    The table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the  center. Once the table is set and the food served, Malee  takes a step back and smiles.    INT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER    Malee strips off her clothes and puts on a long, silk robe.    EXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME    Gus drives up, gets out of his car and enters the building.    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER    Gus approaches his door. As he takes out his key, he notices  that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side. Gus  lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone.    INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - FRONT ENTRANCE/ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS    Gus enters. He knows someone else is in there.    GUS  Hello?    We follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing  beside the table and dressed only in her robe.    GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What the hell is this?    MALEE  I made dinner, my love. And I have  a surprise.    GUS  You've been in my apartment before,  haven't you?    Malee drops her robe, revealing her naked body. Gus quickly  looks away.    GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Malee, put your clothes on now!          (CONTINUED)    82.  CONTINUED:    MALEE  Don't you like my body?    Malee starts walking towards him.    GUS  Malee, stop.    MALEE  It's okay because I love you.    Gus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now. She puts  her head on his back.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Touch me.    Gus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long,  pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of  what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses  to the living room.    MALEE (cont'd)  Where are you going?    GUS  To go call your mother.    Gus exits. Malee stands the fool.    MALEE  But we're soulmates.    Now embarrassed and crushed, she starts to cry.    EXT. GUS'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT    Malee, now wrapped in a large overcoat, is led by Yacco out  of the building and over to her car.    INT. YACCO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS    Yacco and Malee sit in silence. After a beat.    YACCO  I don't know what to say to you.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON    Jacob shoves clothes into his backpack.    Keith enters with Rudy's baseball glove on his hand.      (CONTINUED)    83.  CONTINUED:    KEITH  Wanna play some catch?    Jacob notices the glove. He rushes over to Keith, yanks it  off his hand and pushes Keith to the ground.    JACOB  Where the hell did you get this?    KEITH  The closet. Ow, what's wrong?    Keith struggles to get free, but Jacob is too strong.    KEITH (CONT'D) (cont'd)  You're hurting me.    JACOB  Did I say you could play with the  glove? Did I?    KEITH  No, I just...    JACOB  Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING  in this room is mine. You are not  allowed to touch a thing,  especially the glove.    KEITH  Okay, okay.    Jacob gets off of Keith and crosses to his closet. He pulls  out the lock box, unlocks it and removes the gun. He points  it at Keith.    JACOB  If you tell my parents what I said,  I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in  the fucking face, I swear it!    Keith nods, petrified. Jacob puts the gun back in the lock  box, throws it in the closet and storms out of the room.    INT. JACOB'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER    Ashley sits at the kitchen table, looking at a picture of  Rudy and Jacob when they were infants. Her eyes are filled,  but she's not crying.          (CONTINUED)    84.  CONTINUED:    Jacob enters and crosses to the fridge. He spots Ashley and  is taken aback by her state.    JACOB  (cold)  What's wrong now?    ASHLEY  I was looking at a picture of you  and Rudy when you were born. God,  I miss him.    JACOB  But you have Keith now    Ashley is struck by Jacob's comment.    ASHLEY  What the hell does that mean?    JACOB  You have Keith. Two boys again.  Everything is fine.    ASHLEY  We didn't adopt Keith to replace  Rudy.    JACOB  Didn't you?    ASHLEY  For your information, your father  and I discussed adopting for years.    JACOB  (not buying it)  Right. Maybe if it was me who  died, you wouldn't need another kid  to get over it.    ASHLEY  How can you say that? I never  wanted either of my children to  die.    JACOB  But one of us did. If you had to  choose which one, I bet you wish it  was me.          (CONTINUED)    85.  CONTINUED: (2)    ASHLEY  I know you think we favored Rudy...    JACOB  You did! Admit it.    ASHLEY  I admit he was easier to raise, but  we didn't love him more. Jacob,  listen to me. You came with a  different set of challenges.    JACOB  My birthmark.    ASHLEY  It's not easy being different...    JACOB  (screams)  I'm not different!! You always  made me feel like something was  wrong. There's nothing wrong with  me.    ASHLEY  I know...    JACOB  No, you don't! It's like you don't  know how to deal with me. You  never did.    ASHLEY  I'm sorry if that is how you feel.  You do the best you can as a  parent. You don't always know  what's right. But you're my son.  I'd do anything for you. I'd fight  for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die  for you.    JACOB  Rudy used to say that exact same  thing.    ASHLEY  It's true. And as unchristian as  it sounds, I still want the boy  that killed Rudy dead. Someday,  when you grow up, you'll understand  what I mean. Someday.    86.        INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME    SFX: TOILET FLUSHING    Grace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the  basement, looking for a way out. She crosses to the boarded  up door and tries to pull the boards off. Unsuccessful, she  returns to the bed and sits.    After a beat, Grace spots the tray of food, which is still  untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it  at the wall.    CUT TO:    LATER THAT NIGHT -    Grace paces nervously while blabbering to herself.    GRACE  When Pat calls, and I don't answer,  he'll know something is wrong.  He'll know. I'll be fine.    CUT TO:    LATER THAT NIGHT -    Grace nervously rocks back and forth. Sweat covers her body.  She glances at the tray of food, which rests on the floor.    CUT TO:    LATER THAT NIGHT -    Grace stands at the base of the stairwell, screaming.    GRACE  Open this door now! Let me out,  God damn it! Leonard!    CUT TO:    LATER THAT NIGHT -    Grace is crying. She catches sight of the meal that she  threw on the floor.    After a beat, Grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it  down her throat. She doesn't seem bothered by the fact that  her dinner is covered with dirt.    87.        INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - NEXT DAY - AFTERNOON    Yacco exits her office to find Gus waiting for his session.  They speak not a word. He rises and enters the office. She  follows, shutting the door behind her.    INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    Gus and Yacco sit in their respective seats.    YACCO  Before we begin, I want to  apologize. I should have known  what was going on with Malee.    GUS  It's my fault. I knew she had a  crush on me. I guess, I felt bad  for her. She's a very unhappy  girl.    Yacco looks down, embarrassed.    GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)  If it's any consolation, the whole  thing was very \"therapeutic\" for  me.  (off Yacco's look)  Sorry. That was a very selfish  thing to say.    YACCO  This is your therapy. Not mine.  Why was it therapeutic?    GUS  I slept last night. I can't  remember the last time I slept so  deep or so sound. I don't remember  dreaming or anything.    YACCO  Why do you think that is?    GUS  One of the last fires I ever fought  was a brownstone, beautiful. The  place was burned from roof to  basement. Whole family was wiped  out. When I was upstairs,  inspecting, I found a girl. She  couldn't have been more than 12.  (MORE)    (CONTINUED)    88.  CONTINUED:  GUS (cont'd)  The whole right side of her face  was burnt off, but her eyes were  open. She was alive. The pain must  have been excruciating. She was  begging for me to... kill her.    YACCO  What did you do?    GUS  Exactly what she wanted. I placed  my hand over her mouth and what was  left of her nose, and I... I killed  her. I told myself it was the  right thing to do, but I've never  been sure.    YACCO  What does this have to do with  Malee?    GUS  When I saw her last night, she had  the same look on her face as that  girl. She just wanted me to take  away her pain.    Yacco sits, pondering all of this.    GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Doctor?    YACCO  Would you mind if we... cut out  early today? No charge.    GUS  I understand.    Gus rises and exits.    Yacco sits alone and starts crying.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER    Leonard is at the kitchen sink, arranging a fruit salad.    SUDDENLY, he hears the sound of water boiling over from the  stove. Leonard quickly turns the gas low, extinguishing the  flame. He removes the pot from the burner, grabs a strainer  and removes poached EGG WHITES from the water.          (CONTINUED)    89.  CONTINUED:    Leonard grabs a dish towel and begins wiping the water off  the stove. Preoccupied, he doesn't realize that when he  wipes the oven knob dry, he turns the gas on high. (Since  the overflowing water, extinguished the pilot light, he is  unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner.) In  his condition, HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT.    Leonard grabs the plates of food and exits the kitchen.    SFX: GAS LEAKING    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER    Leonard places the food by Grace's bed. She is sleeping.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER    Leonard sits on the couch, watching TV. Suddenly, he starts  coughing, hard. The fit subsides and Leonard resumes  watching TV, thinking nothing of it.    INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING    SFX: TELEPHONE    Malee enters the kitchen and answers the phone.    MALEE (INTO PHONE)  Hello?... Daddy!... No, she's not  home... Can I ask you something?  Can I visit you for a while?... A  week... But I can fly alone... No,  I understand... Yeah... I love y...  Hello?...    Malee hangs up the phone. Tears swell in her eyes. She  places her head in her arms and start bawling.    YACCO (O.S.)  Honey?    Malee looks to find Yacco standing behind her.    MALEE  (through her tears)  Why does he hate me?    Yacco walks to Malee and hugs her tight. It's a long,  overdue hug.    90.        INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - LATER THAT DAY    Grace awakens from her nap. Suddenly, she sniffs at the air.    Grace rises and crosses over to the foot of the basement  stairs. She sees that the upstairs door is wide open.    GRACE  Leonard!    Silence.    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard, I smell gas!    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - DEN - SAME TIME    Leonard is slumped over, unconscious.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME    Grace coughs hard.    GRACE  Leonard, don't you smell that...?  (sotto)  Oh God, he can't. Leonard!  Leonard, the gas is on!    Grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the  stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing.    With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the  GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels  her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes  separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap.    Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side.  With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing.    INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS    Exhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove  and shuts the gas off. She looks around for Leonard and sees  him in the living room, slumped over and unconscious.    GRACE  No!    Grace frantically shuffles over to the living room.          (CONTINUED)    91.  CONTINUED:    GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Leonard, wake up! Leonard!    INT. HOSPTIAL ROOM - NIGHT    Leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed. The same nurse  from earlier is by his side.    NURSE  It's alive!    LEONARD  What happened?    NURSE  Gas leak.    LEONARD  My mom, she's...    NURSE  She's fine. They've taken her into  surgery. She blew out her knees  somehow. We're trying to get your  father on the phone right now.    LEONARD  I...    NURSE  Shh. You need your rest.  Everything is fine now.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY    Jacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over  the foundation of a house. Jacob appears lost in thought.  He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together.    Jacob touches his face in the photograph. He traces his  finger along the outline of his birthmark.    KENNY (O.S.)  Tonight, we ride.    EXT. TRAILER PARK - BESIDE KENNY'S TRAILER - DUSK    Jacob and Kenny share a cigarette.    KENNY  We got sleeping bags, a tent,  canteens and a lantern.  (MORE)    (CONTINUED)    92.  CONTINUED:  KENNY (cont'd)  I heard it's supposed to rain, so  I'll bring ponchos.    JACOB  (half hearted)  Cool.    Kenny eyes Jacob.    KENNY  You're acting weird. You gonna  chicken out?    JACOB  No.    KENNY  You better not. I already packed  twice the amount of shit. I can't  carry it all alone.    JACOB  I'll be there.    KENNY  Good. I'm telling you, man. It's  gonna be great.    JACOB  I guess.    KENNY  Come on. You can't be a pussy all  your life.    JACOB  (beat, hauntingly)  I know.    KENNY  I'll see you tonight. Don't be  late.    Kenny rides off. Jacob watches him go. He has a lifeless,  almost calculating look in his eyes.    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT    Grace lies in a hosptial bed, watching TV. Leonard enters,  dressed in a hospital gown. Grace turns to him, smiling.    GRACE  Leonard!      (CONTINUED)    93.  CONTINUED:    LEONARD  I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to  leave the gas on. It was an  accident. And everything that  happened, I... I just thought that  maybe, I could help you.    GRACE  Leonard, my mother died at 52. We  had to cremate her body because  they didn't make a coffin big  enough for her to fit in. Even if  they had, no one could have carried  it.  (tearing up)  I loved her so much. I don't want  that to happen to me.    LEONARD  It doesn't have to.    GRACE  Even if I can manage the food...  Can you honestly see me, running a  marathon?    LEONARD  You don't have to run a marathon.  You just have to run to the end of  the block. It's not so hard as you  think it is.    GRACE  I'll try.    Leonard leans over and kisses his mother's forehead.    GRACE (cont'd)  I spoke to your father. He and the  girls caught a flight. They should  be here by morning.    LEONARD  Did you tell him what happened?    GRACE  I told him there was a gas leak.    LEONARD  I meant...          (CONTINUED)    94.  CONTINUED: (2)    GRACE  I know what you meant. I didn't  tell him. I don't think I will.    Leonard smiles.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT    Jacob lies awake, staring out the window. A heavy wind  blows.    SFX: WATCH ALARM    Jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm.    Keith awakens as well, but remains silent. He watches as  Jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window.    Once he's gone, Keith gets off the top bunk, crosses to the  window and watches as Jacob runs off.    Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the  lock box and begins trying combinations to open it.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER    A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees  Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house.    KENNY  You're late.    JACOB  I'm here.    Kenny throws Jacob a PONCHO.    KENNY  Put this on.    Jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho. Then he  opens his backpack and removes his HOCKEY MASK. (The same  mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie.)    KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What the fuck is that?    JACOB  If people see me riding around in  the middle of the night, we're  screwed. You didn't bring a  disguise?      (CONTINUED)    95.  CONTINUED:    KENNY  Who gives a shit what I'm up to.    The boys start riding off in opposite directions.    KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  The main road is this way.    JACOB  Yeah, but if we cut through the  construction site, we'll hit the  railroad tracks. It's faster and  no one will bother us.    KENNY  Good point.    Kenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep  into the construction site. Thunder and lightning crash.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and  now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER. He works  frantically, fearing Jacob's return.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME    Jacob and Henry make their way to the edge of the  construction site. Suddenly, Jacob stops in his tracks.    KENNY  What's wrong?    Jacob lifts the hockey mask.    JACOB  I can't do this.    KENNY  What?!    Jacob begins rummaging through his backpack.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME    Keith pries the box open. It's EMPTY. No gun or bullets.    96.        EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME    KENNY  Son of a bitch! I knew it. I knew  you'd chicken...    Jacob rises, holding the gun. He points it at Kenny.    KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)  What the fuck?    Jacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes  he has to do.    JACOB  I can't let you leave, Kenny. You  have to pay for what you did.    KENNY  Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I...  I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll  do my probation.    Jacob cocks the gun. Tears stream down his checks.    JACOB  You killed him. I gotta do this...  for my family. It's the only way.    KENNY  Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an  accident. I swear. Please, don't.  This isn't you.    JACOB  I know. But I can't be a pussy all  my life.    Jacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head. He drops to the  ground instantly.    The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground. As he  falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.    Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body.  Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the  hockey mask.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER    Jacob is inside one of the UNPAVED house foundations, digging  a hole. He cries, struggling to finish what he has done.      (CONTINUED)    97.  CONTINUED:    Once a hole is dug, Jacob throws Kenny's body inside and  starts covering it up with dirt.    INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT    Jacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to  his closet and begins to change. Keith lies in bed, watching.    Jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back  inside the lock box. His hands shake violently. As he puts  the box back inside the closet. He finds Rudy's glove. He  smells the leather and smiles.    Jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed. He places  the glove beside Keith.    KEITH  I thought I wasn't supposed to  touch this.    JACOB  You're awake.    KEITH  Yeah.    JACOB  It's yours. Just don't leave it  outside. If it gets wet, the  leather will crack.    KEITH  I'll take good care of it. I know  this was Rudy's.    Jacob lies down on his bed.    KEITH (cont'd)  Why do you have a gun?    JACOB  Just a b-b gun. I returned it to a  friend of mine.  (beat)  I'm sorry for being such an asshole  to ya.    KEITH  Does this mean we're brothers now?          (CONTINUED)    98.  CONTINUED:    JACOB  (beat, torn apart)  Yeah. We're brothers.    Keith lies back in bed, smiling. Jacob rolls over, still  unnerved by what he is done. He'll never be the same, and he  knows it.    EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY    Gus loads cinder blocks into a wheel barrow.    MALEE (O.S.)  Gus?    Gus spins around, and finds Malee, standing there.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Before you freak out, I want to  tell you, I'm sorry. And to give  you this.    Malee opens her backpack and removes Gus' GUN. Gus snatches  it from her.    GUS  Malee?    MALEE  Don't be mad. I was just worried  about you. Now I'm out of your  life forever. Goodbye. Thanks for  not pressing any charges.    Malee walks off. Gus holds the gun in awe.    EXT. STREET - BESIDE THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME    TIGHT ON JACOB, staring at the construction site. We ZOOM  OUT and find him, straddling his bike.    Malee appears, walking over.    MALEE  Quite a storm last night.    They stand for a moment, watching the builders.    MALEE (cont'd)  Did you hear about Leonard?    Jacob nods, YES.      (CONTINUED)    99.  CONTINUED:    MALEE (cont'd)  Only him. I was gonna go and visit  him at the hospital. You want to  come?    Jacob doesn't answer. He is preoccupied with watching a  TRUCK pour cement into the foundation where Kenny is buried.    It's a bittersweet moment. While relieved by the fact that  his crime will be hidden, the guilt overwhelms him.    MALEE (cont'd)  Earth to Jacob. You coming?    JACOB  Huh? Oh, yeah.    Jacob turns his bike around, and the two ride off together.    MALEE  You know, your birthday's coming  up. Any hints as to what you might  like?    JACOB  Whatever you get me will be fine.    MALEE  (annoyed)  Right.    Malee eyes Jacob, sensing that something is wrong.    MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd)  Are you okay?    JACOB  (lying)  Never better.    BACK ON the foundation. Gus enters frame and begins  spreading cement over Kenny's grave.    FADE TO BLACK:     THE END        12 and Holding Writers :   Anthony Cipriano Genres :   Drama User Comments\n"
